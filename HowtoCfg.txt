1)Every cfg file define the network structure of YOLOv3. Copy one *.cfg from the folder of darknet.
2ï¼‰filters=[4 + 1 + n] * 3, where n is your class count. 
This modification should be made to the layer preceding each of the YOLO layers. 
Modify classes=80 to classes=n in each YOLO layer, where n is your class count.
We will need to update the classes and filters params of [yolo] and [convolutional] 
layers that are just before the [yolo] layers.
